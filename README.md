## DISCLAIMER: smelly code !!

This is a reskin of a project I made in my first bachelor year of computer science at UGent.


We were tasked to make ugentopoly, a monopoly clone, and we had to make sure that it would be pretty easy to change the look by only swapping out the assets and hardly doing anything in the code. In order to see if it worked, I made this reskin.
