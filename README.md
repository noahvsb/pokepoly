# ugentopoly
monopoly but in UGent style!

# pros
- good time guaranteed

# cons
- only in Dutch
- online not supported
- no houses/hotels


# windows ~~and mac~~
- open the `ugentopoly_win`~~/mac~~ folder
- run the `ugentopoly_exe.cmd`~~/sh~~ by double-clicking

(mac doesn't work)

you are a linux user, so you can probably pull your plan on yourself
